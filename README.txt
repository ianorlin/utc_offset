This is a really simple script that I did to keep my bash skills up

I figured it might be useful for some because they do not know the difference to UTC when en irc 
it returns the difference between your date and what happens next.

This can make it easier for new contributors to know when meetings on irc are and give them the number of hours they need to add or subtract.

I am not sure it is year 2038 compliant for some 32 bit cpus but this should  work around end of unix epoch.

It should work locally on irc clients but does not really work in an irc bot as it would be the time zone the irc bot is in. 

Random fact is I wrote this in a hosp ital waiting room.
